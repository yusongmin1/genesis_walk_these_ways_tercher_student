## Heightfield tests

### Quick Tips

1. Use bigger horizontal_scale unless you need more precise height points. Bigger horizontal_scale can reduce the number of heightfield points, which can help shorten the compilation time.
2. Use smaller terrain_length and terrain_width if you need to use smaller horizontal_scale.
